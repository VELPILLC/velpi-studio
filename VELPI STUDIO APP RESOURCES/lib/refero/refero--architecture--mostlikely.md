> Inked archways on bone-white vellum

**Theme:** light

A strict two-color monochrome system — pure ink black and bone white with zero chromatic accent. The signature is the monumental arch: tall vertical forms capped with full semicircular rounding that read as cathedral portals, mausoleum doorways, or architect's drafting silhouettes. Typography is a single custom display face (Rondelle) used at exactly one weight (400) and only two sizes, so hierarchy comes from scale and whitespace rather than weight, color, or decoration. Navigation is a whisper-thin hairline rule across the top with widely-spaced text links. The system is brutally restrained: no shadows, no gradients, no borders other than 1px hairlines, no color punctuation — the arch shape itself does all the emotional work.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Role | Group |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| Ink Black | `#000000` | Page text, all border rules, signature arch fills — the entire graphical language. The 21:1 contrast against white is the system's only expressive tool | neutral |
| Bone White | `#ffffff` | Canvas, card surfaces, and all negative space — the field against which ink shapes register as architecture | neutral |

## Tokens — Typography

- **Rondelle** — sizes: 14px, 30px; weight: 400; line-height: 1.40; letter-spacing: normal. Role: Sole typeface for navigation links, body copy, and headings. Used at exactly one weight (400) across the entire site — the flat weight is deliberate; hierarchy is created by jumping from 14px to 30px (a 2.14× ratio) rather than by weight contrast. The custom face has architectural proportions: tall x-height, geometric construction, even stroke — it reads as drawn rather than typed. Substitute with a geometric humanist sans like 'Söhne' or 'Inter' if Rondelle is unavailable.

## Type Scale

- body-sm: 14px / lh 19.6 / ls 0
- heading: 30px / lh 42 / ls 0

## Spacing & Shape

- Radius — buttons: 0px, cards: 0px, inputs: , tags: 0px
- Element gap: 10px; Section gap: 55-70px; Card padding: 20px; Page max-width: fluid

## Components

### Hairline Navigation Bar
Role: Top-level site navigation
Full-width 1px solid #000000 border-bottom, white background. 5px top/bottom padding, 20px horizontal padding. Links are Rondelle 400 at 14px, #000000, 10px column gap between items. No background, no underline, no active state indicator — selected page is implicit through context or position. The nav floats on white like a single drawn rule across the top of the page.

### Arch Pillar (Signature Shape)
Role: Hero visual element and section divider
Tall vertical rectangle filled solid #000000 with the top edge rounded to a full semicircle (border-top-left-radius and border-top-right-radius equal to 50% of the element's width). The shape extends downward off the visible viewport or to the section floor — its height is never fully revealed at once, giving it a monumental, architectural presence. Width is typically 15-25% of the viewport. No border, no shadow, no gradient. This is the single most identifiable element of the system.

### Arch Cluster
Role: Compositional grouping of signature shapes
Two or more Arch Pillars placed side by side with generous white space between them, creating a rhythm of black portals against white field. Even number (usually two) for symmetry. Total width of the cluster occupies the center 50-60% of the viewport; outer margins are wide and white.

### Text Link
Role: Inline and navigation hyperlinks
Rondelle 400 at 14px, #000000, no underline by default. No hover state changes color or weight — the link is already the same as surrounding text; context (position in nav, surrounding punctuation) signals interactivity. No focus ring beyond the browser default.

### Section Heading
Role: Top-level page or section title
Rondelle 400 at 30px, #000000, line-height 42px. No bold, no italic, no decoration. Sits in generous white space (55-70px top padding above). The single weight and size make it read as a quiet declaration rather than a shout — the 2.14× size jump from 14px body is the only hierarchy signal.

### Body Text Block
Role: Paragraphs and descriptive copy
Rondelle 400 at 14px, #000000, line-height 19.6px. No paragraph spacing beyond 1em. Left-aligned. Maximum measure implied at ~70-80 characters though no hard container is observed.

### Full-Bleed White Section
Role: Primary canvas for content
#ffffff background, no borders, no internal padding constraint. Content sits within generous white margins (70px left/right). Sections are separated by whitespace rather than dividers — the transition from one section to the next is marked by a 55px top padding and a new visual element (arch, text, image).

### Image Frame
Role: Photographic or illustrative content container
1px solid #000000 border around rectangular image containers. No border-radius (0px). Images sit flush within the frame; the hairline border makes them read as printed plates or archival photographs rather than digital content.

## Do

- Use only #000000 and #ffffff. The two-color constraint is the design — any chromatic addition breaks the system.
- Use border-radius equal to 50% of element width to create the arch shape. This is the system's only decorative vocabulary.
- Set all borders to 1px solid #000000. No thicker rules, no dotted, no dashed.
- Apply Rondelle at weight 400 only. Do not introduce 500, 600, or 700 — the flat weight is signature.
- Use 55-70px top padding to separate sections. Whitespace is the only section divider.
- Let arch shapes bleed off the bottom of the viewport to create implied monumentality.
- Maintain 10px column gap between navigation links and 20px horizontal padding on the nav bar.

## Never

- Do not introduce any color other than #000000 and #ffffff. No grays, no accents, no semantic state colors.
- Do not use font-weight values other than 400. Bold, medium, and semibold are absent from the system.
- Do not add box-shadow, text-shadow, or drop-shadow. The system is completely flat.
- Do not use border-radius on cards, buttons, tags, or images. All non-arch elements are sharp-cornered (0px).
- Do not add gradients of any kind. Solid fills only.
- Do not use multiple font families. Rondelle (or its substitute) is the only face.
- Do not add icons, emoji, or decorative glyphs. The arch shape and typography are the only graphic elements.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text: #000000
- background: #ffffff
- border: #000000 (1px hairline)
- accent: #000000 (arch fills are the only accent)
- primary action: no distinct CTA color

**Example Component Prompts**

1. **Build the top navigation**: Full-width white bar with 1px solid #000000 border-bottom. 5px top/bottom padding, 20px left/right padding. Four text links ('Mostlikely', 'Architecture', 'Design', 'Research') in Rondelle 400, 14px, #000000, 10px gap between items. No underlines, no active states, no background changes.

2. **Build the signature arch pillar**: A tall vertical rectangle, 20% of viewport width, filled solid #000000. Set border-top-left-radius and border-top-right-radius to 50% so the top edge forms a full semicircle. No border, no shadow. The element extends below the visible viewport — give it height: 120vh or overflow the parent container.

3. **Build a section heading**: Rondelle 400 at 30px, #000000, line-height 42px. Left-aligned. No bold, no italic. Sit it with 55px padding-top above and generous white space to the right.

4. **Build an image frame**: 1px solid #000000 border around a rectangular image container. border-radius 0px. Image fills the frame edge-to-edge. No caption inside the frame; text lives outside in the surrounding white space.

5. **Build a body text block**: Rondelle 400 at 14px, #000000, line-height 19.6px. Left-aligned. No paragraph indent. One blank line (1em) between paragraphs. Max measure ~70 characters.
