# Limón — Style Reference
> moody brasserie under candlelight

**Theme:** dark

Limón runs on the visual grammar of an evening brasserie: deep olive-black canvases under warm overhead light, food photographed as editorial still-life, and a single flash of saturated lemon yellow that reads as accent illumination rather than decoration. Typography carries unusually wide positive tracking — almost hand-stenciled — which makes the brand name and display lines feel pressed onto glass or neon. The palette is deliberately minimal: one near-black, one forest-deep green, one electric yellow, and one warm cream for the breathing sections. Cards and images are heavy; chrome (buttons, borders, dividers) is feather-light with essentially zero corner radius, giving the whole site a confident, unsoftened edge.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Role | Group |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| Black Olive | `#1d0b0d` | Page background, hero canvas, primary text on light sections — the dominant surface that makes the yellow accent feel like lit signage | neutral |
| Forest Ink | `#103b15` | Headings, body text, list dividers, link color — the deep green gives the dark-mode typography a botanical, not corporate, character | brand |
| Lemon Zest | `#f7ea48` | Filled CTA buttons, large display headlines, accent links, highlight washes — the only chromatic note in the system, used sparingly to ignite dark sections | brand |
| Warm Cream | `#fcf9f0` | Light section backgrounds, card surfaces, off-white content panels — a paper-stock warmth that softens the dark hero without going clinical | neutral |
| Sage Mist | `#dbe2dc` | Hairline dividers, subtle borders, muted accents — a desaturated green-gray that holds the system together without competing with the two brand greens | neutral |
| Pure White | `#ffffff` | Icon strokes, button borders, negative-space punctuation inside the dark canvas | neutral |

## Components

### Top Navigation Bar
Role: Site-wide header with centered logo and split link groups
Dark olive (#1d0b0d) background, full-bleed, ~80px tall. Two-column nav link groups (HOME, MENU, ABOUT US, FAQ, CONTACT on left; FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM on right) set in VenusCom 16px weight 400 letter-spacing 0.04em uppercase in Warm Cream (#fcf9f0). The 'HOME' item uses a 1px white border outline. Wordmark 'LIMÓN' centered at ~46px weight 500, letter-spacing ~1.84px, in Warm Cream. Vertical separators between nav items are implied by spacing rather than drawn.

### Filled CTA Button (Lemon)
Role: Primary action — ordering, reservations
Background: Lemon Zest (#f7ea48). Text: Black Olive (#1d0b0d) at 16px weight 600 letter-spacing 0.04em uppercase. Padding: 12px 16px. Border-radius: 1px (near-square). No border, no shadow. The flat saturated rectangle against the dark canvas is the system's loudest functional element — used sparingly so it stays loud.

### Ghost / Outlined Navigation Item
Role: Active or current-section indicator in the nav bar
Transparent background, 1px solid white (#ffffff) border, 1px radius. VenusCom 16px weight 400 uppercase Warm Cream text with 5–6px horizontal padding. Mirrors the filled CTA's letter-spacing.

### Hero Overlay Display Text
Role: Large editorial wordmark floating over hero photography
Lemon Zest (#f7ea48) at 75px weight 400 line-height 1.00, letter-spacing 4.5px (0.06em). Sits as two words on different lines with generous vertical breathing. Slightly transparent or overlaid on the food photography without a background plate — the text and image share the dark canvas.

### Hero Sub-Line
Role: Supporting hero text under the display wordmark
Warm Cream (#fcf9f0) at 20px weight 400, letter-spacing 0.4px. Plain sentence case, not uppercase. Sits below the display line at ~20px gap.

### Food Card (3-Column Grid)
Role: Menu item tile in the cream section's three-up grid
Square or near-square food photograph as the only visual element — no card chrome, no border, no shadow. Caption sits 30px below the image: VenusCom 20px body in Black Olive or Forest Ink (#103b15), followed by descriptive body copy at 19px, then an 'ORDER NOW' ghost link with right-arrow. Grid gap is ~30px horizontal and ~40px vertical.

### Ghost Link Button (ORDER NOW)
Role: Tertiary action — per-item ordering, inline CTAs in card descriptions
No background, no border. VenusCom 16px weight 500 uppercase, letter-spacing 0.04em, in Forest Ink (#103b15) or Black Olive depending on section. A right-arrow glyph (Font Awesome 6 Free solid) sits inline at 14px. 4px gap between text and arrow. Underline appears on hover only.

### Back-to-Top Circular Button
Role: Floating utility control after scroll
40px diameter circle, Forest Ink (#103b15) background, Warm Cream (#fcf9f0) upward chevron icon centered. Position: fixed bottom-right with ~24px inset. Zero shadow, zero border.

### Featured Dish Banner (Poke/Featured Section)
Role: Full-bleed editorial food section with oversized photography
Warm Cream (#fcf9f0) section background. A single large food photograph offset to the right (roughly right-half of the container, ~55% width), no card or frame. Text and CTA stack to the left at 30–40px gap, with heading at 30–36px and body at 19px.

### Section Heading Block
Role: Standard heading + intro copy used between sections
Centered or left-aligned. Heading in VenusCom 30–36px weight 500, letter-spacing ~1px, in Forest Ink (#103b15) on cream or Warm Cream on dark. Body intro at 19px weight 400. 20–30px margin-bottom between heading and body.

### Body Paragraph
Role: Default readable copy block in menu descriptions and content sections
VenusCom 19px weight 400 line-height 1.30 letter-spacing 0.57px. Color: Forest Ink (#103b15) on cream, or Warm Cream (#fcf9f0) on dark. Max-width ~640px to maintain measure.

## Do

- Use Lemon Zest (#f7ea48) as a filled button background only — never as a text color on a yellow background, and never diluted as a tint.
- Set display headlines (46px and above) with 0.04–0.06em positive letter-spacing; collapse to 0.02–0.04em at body sizes 14–20px.
- Keep corner radius at 1px (or 0px) for all buttons, cards, inputs, and badges — the system is intentionally unsoftened. Reserve 40px radius exclusively for the circular back-to-top button.
- Lay food photography full-bleed or as large edge-to-edge tiles — avoid thin framed images or small thumbnails.
- Use Black Olive (#1d0b0d) as the default canvas for hero and dark sections; switch to Warm Cream (#fcf9f0) only for content-light breathing sections.
- Pair the filled Lemon Zest CTA with a ghost Forest Ink 'ORDER NOW' inline link in the same flow — the system relies on that filled/ghost contrast to establish hierarchy without color overload.
- Keep section padding between 30–60px vertically; 15px is the standard element gap inside a card or list.

## Never

- Don't introduce new accent hues — the system is one near-black, one deep green, one lemon yellow, and cream. Any additional color breaks the candlelight metaphor.
- Don't soften corners with 8–12px radii. The 1px (near-zero) radius is a signature choice; rounding destroys the editorial feel.
- Don't use tight or negative letter-spacing on display text. VenusCom's signature is wide positive tracking; tightening it makes headlines generic.
- Don't place the Lemon Zest CTA on a Warm Cream background — the yellow loses all contrast and visual energy. The CTA belongs on dark.
- Don't add drop shadows, glows, or gradients to cards, buttons, or images. The system is flat and confident; elevation comes from color contrast and scale, not depth effects.
- Don't use Forest Ink (#103b15) as a button background — it is a text/link/border color only. The deep green on dark olive disappears.
- Don't reduce the size of display headlines below 46px or pad the wordmark too tightly — the generous tracking and large scale is what makes the brand name feel like signage.
